Query: {{ query }}

Context:
{% for c in contexts %}
- [{{ loop.index }}] {{ c }}
{% endfor %}

Instruction:
Return STRICT JSON only (no prose). Exactly one object.

If the retrieved context is relevant to the query, summarize the key issue in 3 concise bullet points (â‰¤20 words each).

If the retrieved context is unrelated or insufficient to answer the query, return exactly:
{"bullets": [], "evidence": [], "confidence": 0.0, "note": "No relevant information found"}

Return JSON ONLY in this shape:
{"bullets": ["...", "...", "..."], "evidence": [[1,2],[2],[3]], "confidence": 0.0-1.0}

# Rules
- "evidence" is an array of arrays. Each inner list contains the Context item numbers (from the bracketed [n] above)
  that support the corresponding bullet at the same index.
- Do not invent facts beyond the Context. If unsure, use the refusal JSON above.
